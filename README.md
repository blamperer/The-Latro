# The Latro
When one starts their modding journey, one makes a mod as a playground; The perfect sandbox to get their hands wet.

This is that mod for me.

A mod containing **two** thematic sets, with a sprinkle of miscellany. Not explicitly balanced, but not too unbalanced, hopefully.

-----
Contains:
- **33** Jokers
  - 12 Signs of the Zodiac
  - 12 Days of Christmas
- **1** Deck
- **1** Challenge
